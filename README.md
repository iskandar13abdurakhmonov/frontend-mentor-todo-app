### Useful resources

-   [A Complete Guide to Implementing Dark Mode in React](https://betterprogramming.pub/a-complete-guide-to-implementing-dark-mode-in-react-47af893b22eb) - This helped me for making light and dark mode. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
-   [react-custom-checkbox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-custom-checkbox) - This is an amazing UI Api which helped me to import custom checkboxes. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to use custom checkboxes.
